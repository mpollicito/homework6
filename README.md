"Weather // Dashboard"

## Description
This is a simple app to check weather forecasts, useful for someone possibly planning a short trip or multiple daily outdoor activities. Here we've used APIs to gather weather information and appened the data to the screen. There is a search history which appears under the search bar and optional 5-day forecasts can be displayed also. 
Icons are used to depict the displayed weather (For example, hot days will have a red sun, cold/snow has a snowflake, etc.)

Knowing when/how to use jQuery as opposed to vanilla JavaScript slowed progess.
